<!-- Unfortuately, not all of the sketch.files have a song function. -->
<!-- Only sketch2.js & sketch4.js play music, as long as you click the sketch with the mouse -->
<!-- The goal was to have the music play automatically, but it didn't work out. -->

<!-- The extra view of the user on the right, represents the users placed in front of the sketch -->
<!-- and their reflections being pixelated and rendered into it -->
